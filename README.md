Traditional financial time series prediction methods commonly operate binary labeling by exploring price returns. In this paper, we develop eight approaches utilizing technical indicators and unsupervised models to construct classification into three market states - bull, bear, or static. We introduce an extended multi-dimensional time series analysis. To mitigate the limitations of manual labeling, we implement several supervised learning models and also explore unsupervised learning, including Hidden Markov Model and Gaussian Mixture Model. As a result, labels derived from Hidden Markov Model combined with market state prediction of XGBoost algorithm shows the superior performance of our trading strategies compared to naive buy-and-hold strategy.
